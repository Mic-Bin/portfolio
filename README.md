### Projects

#### Reddit Recipes Chatbot		       					              	   
* Utilized Python and the Llama-Index OpenAI framework to engineer a chatbot that offers personalized culinary tips and over 500 recipe recommendations.
* Leveraged Reddit's API and Pandas to extract top posts from three recipe subreddits, retrieving 16,516 post titles, descriptions, and comments.
* Fine-tuned the chatbot to optimize performance and enhance its ability to understand and respond to queries.	
#### Renewable Energy Analysis		  		      		             
* Used SQL to join three large datasets for analysis and correlation studies, using JOIN and VIEW.
* Applied time series analysis using Pythonâ€™s Scipy and Numpy to gain deeper insights into the relationship between a country's yearly renewable energy generation proportion and GDP
* Visualized the data using Plotly and Altair, revealing crucial insights into the correlation between income levels and greenhouse gas emissions, fostering informed environmental decisions.
#### Seismic Neural Network     					             	       
* Employed PyTorch to develop a Neural Network to identify seafloor horizons autonomously, achieving a 95% accuracy rate in horizon selection.
* Boosted model accuracy by rebalancing the dataset using a weighted random sampler and mitigating overfitting with dropout layers.
#### Facial Feature Recognition                                                                                   	    
* Developed a facial feature recognizer using TensorFlow's Keras,  implementing CNN and achieving 85% accuracy in predicting the coordinates of features on a human face.
* Utilized Matplotlib to visually validate my model's predictions, ensuring accuracy and identifying areas for improvement.
#### Deep Learning From Scratch						 
* Demonstrated expertise in creating custom neural networks for data classification tasks by designing and implementing a DL model from scratch using only Python, NumPy, and Pandas, achieving 91% accuracy in predictive performance.
#### Spotify Song Popularity							               
* Crafted an AdaBoost Regression model leveraging the scikit-learn library to predict song popularity. 
* Achieved a 20% increase in accuracy through feature engineering methods and further optimization with a linear regression base estimator.
